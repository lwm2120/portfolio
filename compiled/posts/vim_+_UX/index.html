            <h3 id="intro">Intro</h3>
<p>The motions (be they by mouse or keyboard) of the cursor while editing are part of a language that works in concert with the written characters themselves.</p>
<p>Typing words or graphemes of some kind requires only the motions of fingertips in the same general area on the keyboard.</p>
<p>Vim brings the cursor motion language previously mentioned to this general area in order to relieve the cognitive (and mechanical) load of switching bodily modalities: serial or random visual search in combination with equivalent cursor movement by mouse.</p>
<h3 id="accelerants">Accelerants</h3>
<p>Vim could be described as having a high accelerant to learnable feature ratio, it is very easy for users with some domain knowledge to do things much more quickly than other programsâ€™ equivalents, than for any user to approach the software and accomplish something (without regard for time taken to complete). At the same time, its extensibility and customizability makes it highly accessible to several uncommon modes of computer interaction (with the correct configuration and peripherals)</p>
